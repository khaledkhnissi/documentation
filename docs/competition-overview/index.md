# Competition Overview

![Motivating image](images/overview.png)

Robotics and AI is revolutionizing the what and how we work today and will continue in the future. Today, robots are augmenting the capability of human workers in various industries: logistics, healthcare, agriculture, etc.

The PARC Engineers league tasks participants to reimagine how humans can augment the
capabilities of intelligent robots in a task of growing prevalence - autonomous parcel
delivery.

The challenge of the competition is to build software to operate a wheeled mobile robot to complete a delivery task including: navigating through a sidewalk, crossing the road using a crosswalk and navigating in a park to find the drop location.

This competition would consist two phases: a simulation phase and a physical robot phase.

### Simulation Phase
In this phase, teams would interact with the delivery robot in simulation (using the Gazebo Robot Simulator). Participants are required to write software to complete three crucial tasks for the operation of a delivery robot:

* Sidewalk following (with obstacle avoidance)
* Traffic sign detection and recognition
* Go-to-goal navigation (with obstacle avoidance)

Participating teams will follow the instructions in this documentation to set up their PCs and download the complete simulation packages required to complete the tasks. 
Teams are required to complete and upload their solutions on or before the Phase 1 deadline. Following team evaluations, teams with the best solutions will qualify to compete in Phase 2.

### Physical Robot Phase

In this phase, the qualified teams get a chance to refine and deploy their software on the physical robot **TurtleBot 3 Burger** to compete on the main competition day. First, a complete simulation of the competition environment would be provided to teams to integrate and their solutions from Phase 1. The task here is to operate the delivery robot to complete a delivery by moving from parcel pickup location to the drop-off location.

Once satisfactory results are achieved in simulation, participants would be allowed to test their software on the physical robot virtually by reserving time on our booking calendar [to be provided]. 
To be allowed to compete on the final competition, teams must submit a report (including videos of their fully functional solution in simulation) and upload their code for review.


### Competition Prizes
- The 1st place winner: **$2,000**
- Other awards for top teams include prizes from sponsors such as laptops, tablets & mentoring!
